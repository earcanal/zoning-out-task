      The story was very pretty and interesting, especially at the point where
      the rivals suddenly recognized one another; and the ladies looked
      agitated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Charming!&rdquo; said Anna Pávlovna with an inquiring glance at the little
      princess.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Charming!&rdquo; whispered the little princess, sticking the needle into her
      work as if to testify that the interest and fascination of the story
      prevented her from going on with it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The vicomte appreciated this silent praise and smiling gratefully prepared
      to continue, but just then Anna Pávlovna, who had kept a watchful eye on
      the young man who so alarmed her, noticed that he was talking too loudly
      and vehemently with the abbé, so she hurried to the rescue. Pierre had
      managed to start a conversation with the abbé about the balance of power,
      and the latter, evidently interested by the young man&rsquo;s simple-minded
      eagerness, was explaining his pet theory. Both were talking and listening
      too eagerly and too naturally, which was why Anna Pávlovna disapproved.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The means are ... the balance of power in Europe and the rights of the
      people,&rdquo; the abbé was saying. &ldquo;It is only necessary for one powerful
      nation like Russia&mdash;barbaric as she is said to be&mdash;to place
      herself disinterestedly at the head of an alliance having for its object
      the maintenance of the balance of power of Europe, and it would save the
      world!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But how are you to get that balance?&rdquo; Pierre was beginning.
    </p>
    <p>
      At that moment Anna Pávlovna came up and, looking severely at Pierre,
      asked the Italian how he stood Russian climate. The Italian&rsquo;s face
      instantly changed and assumed an offensively affected, sugary expression,
      evidently habitual to him when conversing with women.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am so enchanted by the brilliancy of the wit and culture of the
      society, more especially of the feminine society, in which I have had the
      honor of being received, that I have not yet had time to think of the
      climate,&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not letting the abbé and Pierre escape, Anna Pávlovna, the more
      conveniently to keep them under observation, brought them into the larger
      circle.
