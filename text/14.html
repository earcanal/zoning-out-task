      &ldquo;I knew you would be here,&rdquo; replied Pierre. &ldquo;I will come to supper with
      you. May I?&rdquo; he added in a low voice so as not to disturb the vicomte who
      was continuing his story.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, impossible!&rdquo; said Prince Andrew, laughing and pressing Pierre&rsquo;s hand
      to show that there was no need to ask the question. He wished to say
      something more, but at that moment Prince Vasíli and his daughter got up
      to go and the two young men rose to let them pass.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must excuse me, dear Vicomte,&rdquo; said Prince Vasíli to the Frenchman,
      holding him down by the sleeve in a friendly way to prevent his rising.
      &ldquo;This unfortunate fete at the ambassador&rsquo;s deprives me of a pleasure, and
      obliges me to interrupt you. I am very sorry to leave your enchanting
      party,&rdquo; said he, turning to Anna Pávlovna.
    </p>
    <p>
      His daughter, Princess Hélène, passed between the chairs, lightly holding
      up the folds of her dress, and the smile shone still more radiantly on her
      beautiful face. Pierre gazed at her with rapturous, almost frightened,
      eyes as she passed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very lovely,&rdquo; said Prince Andrew.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very,&rdquo; said Pierre.
    </p>
    <p>
      In passing Prince Vasíli seized Pierre&rsquo;s hand and said to Anna Pávlovna:
      &ldquo;Educate this bear for me! He has been staying with me a whole month and
      this is the first time I have seen him in society. Nothing is so necessary
      for a young man as the society of clever women.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Anna Pávlovna smiled and promised to take Pierre in hand. She knew his
      father to be a connection of Prince Vasíli&rsquo;s. The elderly lady who had
      been sitting with the old aunt rose hurriedly and overtook Prince Vasíli
      in the anteroom. All the affectation of interest she had assumed had left
      her kindly and tear-worn face and it now expressed only anxiety and fear.
    </p>
        <p>
      &ldquo;How about my son Borís, Prince?&rdquo; said she, hurrying after him into the
      anteroom. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t remain any longer in Petersburg. Tell me what news I
      may take back to my poor boy.&rdquo;
