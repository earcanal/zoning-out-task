      &ldquo;Wait a moment, I&rsquo;ll get my work.... Now then, what are you thinking of?&rdquo;
       she went on, turning to Prince Hippolyte. &ldquo;Fetch me my workbag.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a general movement as the princess, smiling and talking merrily
      to everyone at once, sat down and gaily arranged herself in her seat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now I am all right,&rdquo; she said, and asking the vicomte to begin, she took
      up her work.
    </p>
    <p>
      Prince Hippolyte, having brought the workbag, joined the circle and moving
      a chair close to hers seated himself beside her.

      <i>Le charmant Hippolyte</i> was surprising by his extraordinary
      resemblance to his beautiful sister, but yet more by the fact that in
      spite of this resemblance he was exceedingly ugly. His features were like
      his sister&rsquo;s, but while in her case everything was lit up by a joyous,
      self-satisfied, youthful, and constant smile of animation, and by the
      wonderful classic beauty of her figure, his face on the contrary was
      dulled by imbecility and a constant expression of sullen self-confidence,
      while his body was thin and weak. His eyes, nose, and mouth all seemed
      puckered into a vacant, wearied grimace, and his arms and legs always fell
      into unnatural positions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not going to be a ghost story?&rdquo; said he, sitting down beside the
      princess and hastily adjusting his lorgnette, as if without this
      instrument he could not begin to speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why no, my dear fellow,&rdquo; said the astonished narrator, shrugging his
      shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because I hate ghost stories,&rdquo; said Prince Hippolyte in a tone which
      showed that he only understood the meaning of his words after he had
      uttered them.
    </p>
    <p>
      He spoke with such self-confidence that his hearers could not be sure
      whether what he said was very witty or very stupid. He was dressed in a
      dark-green dress coat, knee breeches of the color of <i>cuisse de nymphe
      effray√©e</i>, as he called it, shoes, and silk stockings.

        <p>
      The vicomte told his tale very neatly. It was an anecdote, then current,
      to the effect that the Duc d&rsquo;Enghien had gone secretly to Paris to visit
      Mademoiselle George; that at her house he came upon Bonaparte, who also
      enjoyed the famous actress&rsquo; favors, and that in his presence Napoleon
      happened to fall into one of the fainting fits to which he was subject,
      and was thus at the duc&rsquo;s mercy. The latter spared him, and this
      magnanimity Bonaparte subsequently repaid by death.
