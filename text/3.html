      Prince Vasíli wished to obtain this post for his son, but others were
      trying through the Dowager Empress Márya Fëdorovna to secure it for the
      baron.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anna Pávlovna almost closed her eyes to indicate that neither she nor
      anyone else had a right to criticize what the Empress desired or was
      pleased with.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Baron Funke has been recommended to the Dowager Empress by her sister,&rdquo;
       was all she said, in a dry and mournful tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      As she named the Empress, Anna Pávlovna&rsquo;s face suddenly assumed an
      expression of profound and sincere devotion and respect mingled with
      sadness, and this occurred every time she mentioned her illustrious
      patroness. She added that Her Majesty had deigned to show Baron Funke <i>beaucoup
      d&rsquo;estime</i>, and again her face clouded over with sadness.
    </p>
    <p>
      The prince was silent and looked indifferent. But, with the womanly and
      courtierlike quickness and tact habitual to her, Anna Pávlovna wished both
      to rebuke him (for daring to speak as he had done of a man recommended to
      the Empress) and at the same time to console him, so she said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now about your family. Do you know that since your daughter came out
      everyone has been enraptured by her? They say she is amazingly beautiful.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The prince bowed to signify his respect and gratitude.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I often think,&rdquo; she continued after a short pause, drawing nearer to the
      prince and smiling amiably at him as if to show that political and social
      topics were ended and the time had come for intimate conversation&mdash;&ldquo;I
      often think how unfairly sometimes the joys of life are distributed. Why
      has fate given you two such splendid children? I don&rsquo;t speak of Anatole,
      your youngest. I don&rsquo;t like him,&rdquo; she added in a tone admitting of no
      rejoinder and raising her eyebrows. &ldquo;Two such charming children. And
      really you appreciate them less than anyone, and so you don&rsquo;t deserve to
      have them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And she smiled her ecstatic smile.
