      &ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t speak to me of Austria. Perhaps I don&rsquo;t understand things, but
      Austria never has wished, and does not wish, for war. She is betraying us!
      Russia alone must save Europe. Our gracious sovereign recognizes his high
      vocation and will be true to it. That is the one thing I have faith in!
      Our good and wonderful sovereign has to perform the noblest role on earth,
      and he is so virtuous and noble that God will not forsake him. He will
      fulfill his vocation and crush the hydra of revolution, which has become
      more terrible than ever in the person of this murderer and villain! We
      alone must avenge the blood of the just one.... Whom, I ask you, can we
      rely on?... England with her commercial spirit will not and cannot
      understand the Emperor Alexander&rsquo;s loftiness of soul. She has refused to
      evacuate Malta. She wanted to find, and still seeks, some secret motive in
      our actions. What answer did Novosíltsev get? None. The English have not
      understood and cannot understand the self-abnegation of our Emperor who
      wants nothing for himself, but only desires the good of mankind. And what
      have they promised? Nothing! And what little they have promised they will
      not perform! Prussia has always declared that Buonaparte is invincible,
      and that all Europe is powerless before him.... And I don&rsquo;t believe a word
      that Hardenburg says, or Haugwitz either. This famous Prussian neutrality
      is just a trap. I have faith only in God and the lofty destiny of our
      adored monarch. He will save Europe!&rdquo;

      She suddenly paused, smiling at her own impetuosity.
    </p>

      &ldquo;I think,&rdquo; said the prince with a smile, &ldquo;that if you had been sent
      instead of our dear Wintzingerode you would have captured the King of
      Prussia&rsquo;s consent by assault. You are so eloquent. Will you give me a cup
      of tea?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In a moment. <i>À propos</i>,&rdquo; she added, becoming calm again, &ldquo;I am
      expecting two very interesting men tonight, le Vicomte de Mortemart, who
      is connected with the Montmorencys through the Rohans, one of the best
      French families. He is one of the genuine <i>émigrés</i>, the good ones.
      And also the Abbé Morio. Do you know that profound thinker? He has been
      received by the Emperor. Had you heard?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall be delighted to meet them,&rdquo; said the prince. &ldquo;But tell me,&rdquo; he
      added with studied carelessness as if it had only just occurred to him,
      though the question he was about to ask was the chief motive of his visit,
      &ldquo;is it true that the Dowager Empress wants Baron Funke to be appointed
      first secretary at Vienna? The baron by all accounts is a poor creature.&rdquo;
