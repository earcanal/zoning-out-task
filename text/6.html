      To each new arrival Anna P치vlovna said, &ldquo;You have not yet seen my aunt,&rdquo;
       or &ldquo;You do not know my aunt?&rdquo; and very gravely conducted him or her to a
      little old lady, wearing large bows of ribbon in her cap, who had come
      sailing in from another room as soon as the guests began to arrive; and
      slowly turning her eyes from the visitor to her aunt, Anna P치vlovna
      mentioned each one&rsquo;s name and then left them.

      Each visitor performed the ceremony of greeting this old aunt whom not one
      of them knew, not one of them wanted to know, and not one of them cared
      about; Anna P치vlovna observed these greetings with mournful and solemn
      interest and silent approval. The aunt spoke to each of them in the same
      words, about their health and her own, and the health of Her Majesty,
      &ldquo;who, thank God, was better today.&rdquo; And each visitor, though politeness
      prevented his showing impatience, left the old woman with a sense of
      relief at having performed a vexatious duty and did not return to her the
      whole evening.

      The young Princess Bolk칩nskaya had brought some work in a gold-embroidered
      velvet bag. Her pretty little upper lip, on which a delicate dark down was
      just perceptible, was too short for her teeth, but it lifted all the more
      sweetly, and was especially charming when she occasionally drew it down to
      meet the lower lip. As is always the case with a thoroughly attractive
      woman, her defect&mdash;the shortness of her upper lip and her half-open
      mouth&mdash;seemed to be her own special and peculiar form of beauty.
      Everyone brightened at the sight of this pretty young woman, so soon to
      become a mother, so full of life and health, and carrying her burden so
      lightly. Old men and dull dispirited young ones who looked at her, after
      being in her company and talking to her a little while, felt as if they
      too were becoming, like her, full of life and health. All who talked to
      her, and at each word saw her bright smile and the constant gleam of her
      white teeth, thought that they were in a specially amiable mood that day.

      The little princess went round the table with quick, short, swaying steps,
      her workbag on her arm, and gaily spreading out her dress sat down on a
      sofa near the silver samovar, as if all she was doing was a pleasure to
      herself and to all around her. &ldquo;I have brought my work,&rdquo; said she in
      French, displaying her bag and addressing all present. &ldquo;Mind, Annette, I
      hope you have not played a wicked trick on me,&rdquo; she added, turning to her
      hostess. &ldquo;You wrote that it was to be quite a small reception, and just
      see how badly I am dressed.&rdquo; And she spread out her arms to show her
      short-waisted, lace-trimmed, dainty gray dress, girdled with a broad
      ribbon just below the breast.
