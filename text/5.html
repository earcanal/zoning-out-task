      &ldquo;Her father is very rich and stingy. He lives in the country. He is the
      well-known Prince Bolkónski who had to retire from the army under the late
      Emperor, and was nicknamed &lsquo;the King of Prussia.&rsquo; He is very clever but
      eccentric, and a bore. The poor girl is very unhappy. She has a brother; I
      think you know him, he married Lise Meinen lately. He is an aide-de-camp
      of Kutúzov&rsquo;s and will be here tonight.&rdquo;

      &ldquo;Listen, dear Annette,&rdquo; said the prince, suddenly taking Anna Pávlovna&rsquo;s
      hand and for some reason drawing it downwards. &ldquo;Arrange that affair for me
      and I shall always be your most devoted slave-<i>slafe</i> with an <i>f</i>,
      as a village elder of mine writes in his reports. She is rich and of good
      family and that&rsquo;s all I want.&rdquo;

      And with the familiarity and easy grace peculiar to him, he raised the
      maid of honor&rsquo;s hand to his lips, kissed it, and swung it to and fro as he
      lay back in his armchair, looking in another direction.

      <i>&ldquo;Attendez,&rdquo;</i> said Anna Pávlovna, reflecting, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll speak to Lise,
      young Bolkónski&rsquo;s wife, this very evening, and perhaps the thing can be
      arranged. It shall be on your family&rsquo;s behalf that I&rsquo;ll start my
      apprenticeship as old maid.&rdquo;

      CHAPTER II

      Anna Pávlovna&rsquo;s drawing room was gradually filling. The highest Petersburg
      society was assembled there: people differing widely in age and character
      but alike in the social circle to which they belonged. Prince Vasíli&rsquo;s
      daughter, the beautiful Hélène, came to take her father to the
      ambassador&rsquo;s entertainment; she wore a ball dress and her badge as maid of
      honor. The youthful little Princess Bolkónskaya, known as <i>la femme la
      plus séduisante de Pétersbourg</i>*, was also there. She had been married
      during the previous winter, and being pregnant did not go to any large
      gatherings, but only to small receptions. Prince Vasíli&rsquo;s son, Hippolyte,
      had come with Mortemart, whom he introduced. The Abbé Morio and many
      others had also come.
