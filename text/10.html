      The vicomte wished to begin his story and gave a subtle smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come over here, Hélène, dear,&rdquo; said Anna Pávlovna to the beautiful young
      princess who was sitting some way off, the center of another group.
    </p>
    <p>
      The princess smiled. She rose with the same unchanging smile with which
      she had first entered the room&mdash;the smile of a perfectly beautiful
      woman. With a slight rustle of her white dress trimmed with moss and ivy,
      with a gleam of white shoulders, glossy hair, and sparkling diamonds, she
      passed between the men who made way for her, not looking at any of them
      but smiling on all, as if graciously allowing each the privilege of
      admiring her beautiful figure and shapely shoulders, back, and bosom&mdash;which
      in the fashion of those days were very much exposed&mdash;and she seemed
      to bring the glamour of a ballroom with her as she moved toward Anna
      Pávlovna. Hélène was so lovely that not only did she not show any trace of
      coquetry, but on the contrary she even appeared shy of her unquestionable
      and all too victorious beauty. She seemed to wish, but to be unable, to
      diminish its effect.

    <p>
      &ldquo;How lovely!&rdquo; said everyone who saw her; and the vicomte lifted his
      shoulders and dropped his eyes as if startled by something extraordinary
      when she took her seat opposite and beamed upon him also with her
      unchanging smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madame, I doubt my ability before such an audience,&rdquo; said he, smilingly
      inclining his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      The princess rested her bare round arm on a little table and considered a
      reply unnecessary. She smilingly waited. All the time the story was being
      told she sat upright, glancing now at her beautiful round arm, altered in
      shape by its pressure on the table, now at her still more beautiful bosom,
      on which she readjusted a diamond necklace. From time to time she smoothed
      the folds of her dress, and whenever the story produced an effect she
      glanced at Anna Pávlovna, at once adopted just the expression she saw on
      the maid of honor&rsquo;s face, and again relapsed into her radiant smile.

      The little princess had also left the tea table and followed Hélène.
