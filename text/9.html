      CHAPTER III
    </h2>
    <p>
      Anna Pávlovna&rsquo;s reception was in full swing. The spindles hummed steadily
      and ceaselessly on all sides. With the exception of the aunt, beside whom
      sat only one elderly lady, who with her thin careworn face was rather out
      of place in this brilliant society, the whole company had settled into
      three groups. One, chiefly masculine, had formed round the abbé. Another,
      of young people, was grouped round the beautiful Princess Hélène, Prince
      Vasíli&rsquo;s daughter, and the little Princess Bolkónskaya, very pretty and
      rosy, though rather too plump for her age. The third group was gathered
      round Mortemart and Anna Pávlovna.

    <p>
      The vicomte was a nice-looking young man with soft features and polished
      manners, who evidently considered himself a celebrity but out of
      politeness modestly placed himself at the disposal of the circle in which
      he found himself. Anna Pávlovna was obviously serving him up as a treat to
      her guests. As a clever maître d&rsquo;hôtel serves up as a specially choice
      delicacy a piece of meat that no one who had seen it in the kitchen would
      have cared to eat, so Anna Pávlovna served up to her guests, first the
      vicomte and then the abbé, as peculiarly choice morsels. The group about
      Mortemart immediately began discussing the murder of the Duc d&rsquo;Enghien.
      The vicomte said that the Duc d&rsquo;Enghien had perished by his own
      magnanimity, and that there were particular reasons for Buonaparte&rsquo;s
      hatred of him.

    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, yes! Do tell us all about it, Vicomte,&rdquo; said Anna Pávlovna, with a
      pleasant feeling that there was something <i>à la Louis XV</i> in the
      sound of that sentence: <i>&ldquo;Contez nous çela, Vicomte.&rdquo;</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      The vicomte bowed and smiled courteously in token of his willingness to
      comply. Anna Pávlovna arranged a group round him, inviting everyone to
      listen to his tale.
    </p>
        <p>
      &ldquo;The vicomte knew the duc personally,&rdquo; whispered Anna Pávlovna to one of
      the guests. &ldquo;The vicomte is a wonderful raconteur,&rdquo; said she to another.
      &ldquo;How evidently he belongs to the best society,&rdquo; said she to a third; and
      the vicomte was served up to the company in the choicest and most
      advantageous style, like a well-garnished joint of roast beef on a hot
      dish.
