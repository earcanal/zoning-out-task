      Influence in society, however, is a capital which has to be economized if
      it is to last. Prince Vasíli knew this, and having once realized that if
      he asked on behalf of all who begged of him, he would soon be unable to
      ask for himself, he became chary of using his influence. But in Princess
      Drubetskáya&rsquo;s case he felt, after her second appeal, something like qualms
      of conscience. She had reminded him of what was quite true; he had been
      indebted to her father for the first steps in his career. Moreover, he
      could see by her manners that she was one of those women&mdash;mostly
      mothers&mdash;who, having once made up their minds, will not rest until
      they have gained their end, and are prepared if necessary to go on
      insisting day after day and hour after hour, and even to make scenes. This
      last consideration moved him.

      &ldquo;My dear Anna Mikháylovna,&rdquo; said he with his usual familiarity and
      weariness of tone, &ldquo;it is almost impossible for me to do what you ask; but
      to prove my devotion to you and how I respect your father&rsquo;s memory, I will
      do the impossible&mdash;your son shall be transferred to the Guards. Here
      is my hand on it. Are you satisfied?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear benefactor! This is what I expected from you&mdash;I knew your
      kindness!&rdquo; He turned to go.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait&mdash;just a word! When he has been transferred to the Guards...&rdquo;
       she faltered. &ldquo;You are on good terms with Michael Ilariónovich Kutúzov ...
      recommend Borís to him as adjutant! Then I shall be at rest, and then...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Prince Vasíli smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I won&rsquo;t promise that. You don&rsquo;t know how Kutúzov is pestered since
      his appointment as Commander in Chief. He told me himself that all the
      Moscow ladies have conspired to give him all their sons as adjutants.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, but do promise! I won&rsquo;t let you go! My dear benefactor...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Papa,&rdquo; said his beautiful daughter in the same tone as before, &ldquo;we shall
      be late.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, <i>au revoir!</i> Good-by! You hear her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then tomorrow you will speak to the Emperor?&rdquo;
