      CHAPTER IV
    </h2>
    <p>
      Just then another visitor entered the drawing room: Prince Andrew
      Bolkónski, the little princess&rsquo; husband. He was a very handsome young man,
      of medium height, with firm, clearcut features. Everything about him, from
      his weary, bored expression to his quiet, measured step, offered a most
      striking contrast to his quiet, little wife. It was evident that he not
      only knew everyone in the drawing room, but had found them to be so
      tiresome that it wearied him to look at or listen to them. And among all
      these faces that he found so tedious, none seemed to bore him so much as
      that of his pretty wife. He turned away from her with a grimace that
      distorted his handsome face, kissed Anna Pávlovna&rsquo;s hand, and screwing up
      his eyes scanned the whole company.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are off to the war, Prince?&rdquo; said Anna Pávlovna.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;General Kutúzov,&rdquo; said Bolkónski, speaking French and stressing the last
      syllable of the general&rsquo;s name like a Frenchman, &ldquo;has been pleased to take
      me as an aide-de-camp....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And Lise, your wife?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She will go to the country.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you not ashamed to deprive us of your charming wife?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <i>&ldquo;André,&rdquo;</i> said his wife, addressing her husband in the same
      coquettish manner in which she spoke to other men, &ldquo;the vicomte has been
      telling us such a tale about Mademoiselle George and Buonaparte!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Prince Andrew screwed up his eyes and turned away. Pierre, who from the
      moment Prince Andrew entered the room had watched him with glad,
      affectionate eyes, now came up and took his arm. Before he looked round
      Prince Andrew frowned again, expressing his annoyance with whoever was
      touching his arm, but when he saw Pierre&rsquo;s beaming face he gave him an
      unexpectedly kind and pleasant smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There now!... So you, too, are in the great world?&rdquo; said he to Pierre.
