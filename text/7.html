      &ldquo;<i>Soyez tranquille, Lise</i>, you will always be prettier than anyone
      else,&rdquo; replied Anna Pávlovna.

    <p>
      &ldquo;You know,&rdquo; said the princess in the same tone of voice and still in
      French, turning to a general, &ldquo;my husband is deserting me? He is going to
      get himself killed. Tell me what this wretched war is for?&rdquo; she added,
      addressing Prince Vasíli, and without waiting for an answer she turned to
      speak to his daughter, the beautiful Hélène.

    <p>
      &ldquo;What a delightful woman this little princess is!&rdquo; said Prince Vasíli to
      Anna Pávlovna.

      One of the next arrivals was a stout, heavily built young man with
      close-cropped hair, spectacles, the light-colored breeches fashionable at
      that time, a very high ruffle, and a brown dress coat. This stout young
      man was an illegitimate son of Count Bezúkhov, a well-known grandee of
      Catherine&rsquo;s time who now lay dying in Moscow. The young man had not yet
      entered either the military or civil service, as he had only just returned
      from abroad where he had been educated, and this was his first appearance
      in society. Anna Pávlovna greeted him with the nod she accorded to the
      lowest hierarchy in her drawing room. But in spite of this lowest-grade
      greeting, a look of anxiety and fear, as at the sight of something too
      large and unsuited to the place, came over her face when she saw Pierre
      enter. Though he was certainly rather bigger than the other men in the
      room, her anxiety could only have reference to the clever though shy, but
      observant and natural, expression which distinguished him from everyone
      else in that drawing room.

      &ldquo;It is very good of you, Monsieur Pierre, to come and visit a poor
      invalid,&rdquo; said Anna Pávlovna, exchanging an alarmed glance with her aunt
      as she conducted him to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pierre murmured something unintelligible, and continued to look round as
      if in search of something. On his way to the aunt he bowed to the little
      princess with a pleased smile, as to an intimate acquaintance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anna Pávlovna&rsquo;s alarm was justified, for Pierre turned away from the aunt
      without waiting to hear her speech about Her Majesty&rsquo;s health. Anna
      Pávlovna in dismay detained him with the words: &ldquo;Do you know the Abbé
      Morio? He is a most interesting man.&rdquo;
