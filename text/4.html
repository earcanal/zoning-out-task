      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t help it,&rdquo; said the prince. &ldquo;Lavater would have said I lack the
      bump of paternity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t joke; I mean to have a serious talk with you. Do you know I am
      dissatisfied with your younger son? Between ourselves&rdquo; (and her face
      assumed its melancholy expression), &ldquo;he was mentioned at Her Majesty&rsquo;s and
      you were pitied....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The prince answered nothing, but she looked at him significantly, awaiting
      a reply. He frowned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What would you have me do?&rdquo; he said at last. &ldquo;You know I did all a father
      could for their education, and they have both turned out fools. Hippolyte
      is at least a quiet fool, but Anatole is an active one. That is the only
      difference between them.&rdquo; He said this smiling in a way more natural and
      animated than usual, so that the wrinkles round his mouth very clearly
      revealed something unexpectedly coarse and unpleasant.

    <p>
      &ldquo;And why are children born to such men as you? If you were not a father
      there would be nothing I could reproach you with,&rdquo; said Anna Pávlovna,
      looking up pensively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am your faithful slave and to you alone I can confess that my children
      are the bane of my life. It is the cross I have to bear. That is how I
      explain it to myself. It can&rsquo;t be helped!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He said no more, but expressed his resignation to cruel fate by a gesture.
      Anna Pávlovna meditated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you never thought of marrying your prodigal son Anatole?&rdquo; she asked.
      &ldquo;They say old maids have a mania for matchmaking, and though I don&rsquo;t feel
      that weakness in myself as yet, I know a little person who is very unhappy
      with her father. She is a relation of yours, Princess Mary Bolkónskaya.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Prince Vasíli did not reply, though, with the quickness of memory and
      perception befitting a man of the world, he indicated by a movement of the
      head that he was considering this information.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know,&rdquo; he said at last, evidently unable to check the sad current
      of his thoughts, &ldquo;that Anatole is costing me forty thousand rubles a year?
      And,&rdquo; he went on after a pause, &ldquo;what will it be in five years, if he goes
      on like this?&rdquo; Presently he added: &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what we fathers have to put up
      with.... Is this princess of yours rich?&rdquo;
