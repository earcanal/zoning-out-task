      Although Prince Vasíli listened reluctantly and not very politely to the
      elderly lady, even betraying some impatience, she gave him an ingratiating
      and appealing smile, and took his hand that he might not go away.

      &ldquo;What would it cost you to say a word to the Emperor, and then he would be
      transferred to the Guards at once?&rdquo; said she.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Believe me, Princess, I am ready to do all I can,&rdquo; answered Prince
      Vasíli, &ldquo;but it is difficult for me to ask the Emperor. I should advise
      you to appeal to Rumyántsev through Prince Golítsyn. That would be the
      best way.&rdquo;

      The elderly lady was a Princess Drubetskáya, belonging to one of the best
      families in Russia, but she was poor, and having long been out of society
      had lost her former influential connections. She had now come to
      Petersburg to procure an appointment in the Guards for her only son. It
      was, in fact, solely to meet Prince Vasíli that she had obtained an
      invitation to Anna Pávlovna&rsquo;s reception and had sat listening to the
      vicomte&rsquo;s story. Prince Vasíli&rsquo;s words frightened her, an embittered look
      clouded her once handsome face, but only for a moment; then she smiled
      again and clutched Prince Vasíli&rsquo;s arm more tightly.

    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen to me, Prince,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;I have never yet asked you for anything
      and I never will again, nor have I ever reminded you of my father&rsquo;s
      friendship for you; but now I entreat you for God&rsquo;s sake to do this for my
      son&mdash;and I shall always regard you as a benefactor,&rdquo; she added
      hurriedly. &ldquo;No, don&rsquo;t be angry, but promise! I have asked Golítsyn and he
      has refused. Be the kindhearted man you always were,&rdquo; she said, trying to
      smile though tears were in her eyes.

      &ldquo;Papa, we shall be late,&rdquo; said Princess Hélène, turning her beautiful head
      and looking over her classically molded shoulder as she stood waiting by
      the door.
