      &ldquo;Yes, I have heard of his scheme for perpetual peace, and it is very
      interesting but hardly feasible.&rdquo;

      &ldquo;You think so?&rdquo; rejoined Anna Pávlovna in order to say something and get
      away to attend to her duties as hostess. But Pierre now committed a
      reverse act of impoliteness. First he had left a lady before she had
      finished speaking to him, and now he continued to speak to another who
      wished to get away. With his head bent, and his big feet spread apart, he
      began explaining his reasons for thinking the abbé&rsquo;s plan chimerical.

      &ldquo;We will talk of it later,&rdquo; said Anna Pávlovna with a smile.

      And having got rid of this young man who did not know how to behave, she
      resumed her duties as hostess and continued to listen and watch, ready to
      help at any point where the conversation might happen to flag. As the
      foreman of a spinning mill, when he has set the hands to work, goes round
      and notices here a spindle that has stopped or there one that creaks or
      makes more noise than it should, and hastens to check the machine or set
      it in proper motion, so Anna Pávlovna moved about her drawing room,
      approaching now a silent, now a too-noisy group, and by a word or slight
      rearrangement kept the conversational machine in steady, proper, and
      regular motion. But amid these cares her anxiety about Pierre was evident.
      She kept an anxious watch on him when he approached the group round
      Mortemart to listen to what was being said there, and again when he passed
      to another group whose center was the abbé.

      Pierre had been educated abroad, and this reception at Anna Pávlovna&rsquo;s was
      the first he had attended in Russia. He knew that all the intellectual
      lights of Petersburg were gathered there and, like a child in a toyshop,
      did not know which way to look, afraid of missing any clever conversation
      that was to be heard. Seeing the self-confident and refined expression on
      the faces of those present he was always expecting to hear something very
      profound. At last he came up to Morio. Here the conversation seemed
      interesting and he stood waiting for an opportunity to express his own
      views, as young people are fond of doing.
