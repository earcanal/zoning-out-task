      &ldquo;First of all, dear friend, tell me how you are. Set your friend&rsquo;s mind at
      rest,&rdquo; said he without altering his tone, beneath the politeness and
      affected sympathy of which indifference and even irony could be discerned.

      &ldquo;Can one be well while suffering morally? Can one be calm in times like
      these if one has any feeling?&rdquo; said Anna Pávlovna. &ldquo;You are staying the

      &ldquo;And the fete at the English ambassador&rsquo;s? Today is Wednesday. I must put
      in an appearance there,&rdquo; said the prince. &ldquo;My daughter is coming for me to
      take me there.&rdquo;
